Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework for CLL Cancer Analysis
===========================================================

Overview
--------
This repository presents a comprehensive PyTorch-based framework for analyzing Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) using multi-modal biomedical data. It integrates:
- Microscopy image segmentation
- Genomic feature encoding
- Clinical outcome prediction

The goal is to enable accurate risk stratification and survival prediction for CLL patients by leveraging both morphological and molecular features.

Features
--------
- Microscopy Image Segmentation using U-Net++ or DeepLabV3+
- Genomic Feature Encoding with Transformer-based or CNN models
- Multi-Modal Fusion Network with attention mechanisms
- Survival Prediction using MLP or LSTM models
- Explainability via Grad-CAM and SHAP
- Modular Design for easy experimentation and extension

Dataset Suggestions
-------------------
- Microscopy Images: Public CLL cell image datasets or synthetic data
- Genomic Data: Gene expression profiles from GEO (e.g., GSE50006) or TCGA-CLL
- Clinical Data: Survival times, treatment response, and risk labels

Installation
------------
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CLL-MultiModal-DeepLearning.git
    cd CLL-MultiModal-DeepLearning
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----
Run the main script:

    python main.py

Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for training, evaluation, and explainability workflows.
